The western European hedgehog is in decline in Collserola Natural Park (Barcelona) for various reasons, including the loss of habitats due to urbanisation and infrastructure impact, barrier effect and roadkills on the main road nerwork. Between 2006 and 2008 a radiotracking study was undertaken on 15 hedgehogs (7 0 and 8 Al) released fram the wildlife recovery centre of the Can Balasc Biological Station with the aim of (i) understanding the adaptation and survival capabilities of the recovered individuals after release; (ii) comparing the dispersal tesponse between different release areas; and (iii) characterising the different problems with which they are faced in order to improve their conservation. Hedgehogs released in woodland areas dispersed significancly further during the first days immediately following release when compared to hedgehogs released close to farms, either wirh or without densely vegetated torrents close by. Eventually however, released individuals tended to show similar dispersal ranges independent of the initial release site surroundings. Dispersal ranges varied widely, generally between 5 and 100 ha (mean 55.3Â±117.0 ha), butwith extreme cases of O.21 ha and 465 ha. The mean maximum dispersal distance was just over 1 km, and an absolute maximum of 3.9 km in one case. A tendeney was observed for dispersal towards more ecotonic peripheral and periurban areas of the park. Dispersal to and use of mese areas has consequences for hedgehogs due to the sharp boundary that exists between protected and urban space and the dangers that the larrer represents. Of the 15 hedgehogs tracked it was possible to confirm rhe mortality of at least five of these (33%) during the first two months following their release, the specific causes of deam being varied and similar to the main causes of hedgehog admission to the wildlife recovery centre: attacks by carnivores, roadkill, an accident in an industrial zone and other unknown causes. Recommendations are given on me location of release sites in order to reduce dispersal and minimise mortality, and also on reducing the admission of healthy hedgehogs to centres by a well-meaning publico
